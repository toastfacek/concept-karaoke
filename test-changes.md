# Create Phase Test - Changes Log

This document tracks all changes made during the create phase test implementation and iteration.

## Date: 2025-10-20

### 1. Initial Test Page Implementation

**File Created:** `/app/create-test/page.tsx`

**Description:**
Created a standalone test page for iterating on the creative game loop (big idea → visual → headline → mantra).

**Features:**
- Solo/local-only experience (no multiplayer, no database)
- Free navigation between all 4 phases
- WYSIWYG canvas controls (minimal menus, direct manipulation)
- Persistent context showing all previous work
- localStorage auto-save (500ms debounce)

**Architecture:**
- Single-file implementation (~500 lines)
- Local state management with localStorage persistence
- Phase navigation tabs (freely jump between phases)
- Split layout: left sidebar (context) + right workspace (current phase)

**Data Model:**
```typescript
interface TestAdLob {
  bigIdea: string
  visual: {
    canvasData: CanvasState | null
    notes: string
  }
  headline: {
    canvasData: CanvasState | null
    notes: string
  }
  mantra: string
  brief: string
}
```

**Phase Components:**
1. **Big Idea Phase:** Simple textarea (20-800 chars)
2. **Visual Phase:** Canvas + notes textarea (notes min 10 chars)
3. **Headline Phase:** Canvas (can copy visual as starting point) + notes textarea (min 3 chars)
4. **Mantra Phase:** Textarea with word counter (3 words min, 50-100 target)

**Navigation:**
- Top navigation tabs with completion indicators (✓)
- Clickable sidebar phase cards for quick navigation
- Reset button to clear all data
- Export JSON button to save work externally

### 3. Image Generation Quality Improvements

**Files Modified:** `/app/api/images/generate/route.ts`

**Description:**
Fixed poor image quality caused by prepended prompt instructions that were making images "corny" compared to Google AI Studio.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The code was prepending meta-instructions to user prompts:
- "You are creating an advertising campaign image for a collaborative improv design game."
- "Keep the style bold, playful, and high-contrast so it reads well when sketched over."
- "Avoid adding logos or text in the artwork."

These instructions were:
- Triggering game-like, cartoonish aesthetics ("improv design game")
- Forcing a juvenile style ("bold, playful")
- Making images simpler and flatter ("sketched over")
- Polluting the prompt context

**Changes Made:**

1. **Removed All Wrapper Instructions**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   const promptText = [
     "You are creating an advertising campaign image...",
     "Keep the style bold, playful...",
     "Avoid adding logos or text...",
     `Prompt: ${parsed.data.prompt}`,
   ].join("\n")

   // After:
   const promptText = parsed.data.prompt
   ```

2. **Added Aspect Ratio Configuration**
   ```typescript
   generationConfig: {
     responseModalities: ["Image"],
     imageConfig: {
       aspectRatio: "16:9", // Match canvas dimensions (1600x900)
     },
   }
   ```

3. **Removed Temperature Parameter**
   - Removed `temperature: 0.7` (unused by image model according to Gemini docs)
   - Image generation relies on prompt engineering, not sampling parameters

**Result:**
- Images now match Google AI Studio quality
- Clean, direct prompts without style-forcing
- Proper 16:9 aspect ratio for canvas
- Higher quality, less "corny" results

**Technical Notes:**
- Gemini 2.5 Flash uses Nano Banana for image generation
- Model endpoint: `gemini-2.5-flash-image`
- API docs emphasize "describe the scene, don't just list keywords"
- Quality depends on prompt specificity, not parameters

### 4. Canvas Image UX Improvements - Inline Controls

**Files Modified:** `/components/canvas.tsx`

**Description:**
Completely redesigned image placement and editing UX to be more intuitive and WYSIWYG, removing clunky fixed menus in favor of inline, on-canvas controls.

**Problems Solved:**
- Fixed prompt menu was disconnected from the action (appeared above canvas, not at click location)
- Showed unnecessary position coordinates
- Selected image menu had clunky width/height number inputs (not WYSIWYG)
- Delete button hidden in separate panel, far from the image

**Changes Made:**

1. **Crosshair Cursor for Image Placement**
   - When Image tool is active, cursor changes to crosshair
   - Visual feedback that you're in image placement mode
   - Implemented via conditional className on canvas element

2. **Inline Prompt Box at Click Location**
   - Removed fixed menu above canvas (lines 1354-1387 deleted)
   - Added floating prompt box positioned at exact click location
   - Compact design:
     - Single-line text input (no label clutter)
     - "✓ Generate" and "× Cancel" buttons
     - No position coordinates displayed
   - Box stays within canvas bounds (auto-adjusts position)
   - Uses absolute positioning with z-index overlay
   - Auto-focuses input for immediate typing

   ```tsx
   {!readOnly && promptBoxPosition && (
     <div className="retro-border absolute z-10 w-80 bg-background p-3 shadow-lg">
       <form>
         <input placeholder="Describe the image..." autoFocus />
         <Button>✓ Generate</Button>
         <Button>× Cancel</Button>
       </form>
     </div>
   )}
   ```

3. **Inline Delete Button on Selected Image**
   - Removed entire separate image properties panel (lines 1491-1539 deleted)
   - Added small circular × button overlaid on selected image (top-right corner)
   - Button appears only when image is selected
   - Red border, hover effect for visual feedback
   - Positioned using canvas-to-screen coordinate conversion
   - Single click to delete (no separate menu navigation)

   ```tsx
   {!readOnly && selectedImage && (
     <button
       onClick={handleDeleteSelectedImage}
       className="absolute z-10 h-6 w-6 rounded-full border-2 border-destructive"
       style={{
         left: `${((selectedImage.x + selectedImage.width) / canvasState.size.width) * canvasRef.current.offsetWidth}px`,
         top: `${(selectedImage.y / canvasState.size.height) * canvasRef.current.offsetHeight - 12}px`,
       }}
     >
       ×
     </button>
   )}
   ```

4. **Removed Clunky Controls**
   - ❌ Position display (x, y coordinates)
   - ❌ Width/height number inputs
   - ❌ "Image Details" panel
   - ✅ Kept drag-to-move (existing behavior)
   - ✅ Kept resize handles (existing behavior)

5. **State Management Updates**
   - Added `promptBoxPosition` state for screen coordinates
   - Updated `handlePointerDown` to calculate both canvas and screen positions
   - Updated `handleCancelPendingImage` to clear prompt box position
   - Updated `handleGenerateImage` to clear prompt box after generation

**Result:**
- ✅ Prompt appears exactly where you click (not in fixed menu)
- ✅ No unnecessary coordinate displays
- ✅ Delete button directly on image (not in separate panel)
- ✅ Crosshair cursor indicates placement mode
- ✅ Fully WYSIWYG - controls are at point of action
- ✅ Cleaner, more intuitive interaction flow

**User Flow:**

**Before:**
1. Click Image tool
2. Click canvas → menu appears ABOVE canvas
3. See position coordinates (unnecessary)
4. Type prompt in separate area
5. Click Generate in menu
6. Click image → separate panel opens
7. Find Delete button in panel

**After:**
1. Click Image tool → cursor becomes crosshair
2. Click canvas → prompt box appears AT CLICK LOCATION
3. Type prompt (auto-focused)
4. Click ✓ Generate
5. Click image → × button appears on image
6. Click × to delete

**Technical Implementation:**
- DOM overlay approach (not canvas-rendered)
- Absolute positioning within canvas container
- Coordinate conversion: canvas → screen for positioning
- Boundary detection to keep prompt box visible
- Click event propagation handling

### 5. Canvas Text Tool UX Improvements - Direct Editing & Compact Toolbar

**Files Modified:** `/components/canvas.tsx`

**Description:**
Completely redesigned text editing from large clunky menu panel to direct on-canvas editing with compact icon-based toolbar.

**Problems Solved:**
- Large menu panel took up too much vertical space (entire section below toolbar)
- Indirect editing - had to type in separate textarea instead of on canvas
- Too many controls with labels (Font label + dropdown, Size label + slider, Alignment label + buttons, Color label + swatches, Character counter)
- Not WYSIWYG - editing happened in menu, not where text actually appears

**Changes Made:**

1. **Defined Text Size Presets**
   - Created `TEXT_SIZE_PRESETS` constant with 5 options:
     - Tiny: 20px
     - Small: 32px
     - Medium: 48px (default)
     - Large: 64px
     - Huge: 80px
   - Replaced continuous pixel slider with simple preset dropdown

2. **Added Screen Position Calculation**
   - Created `getTextScreenPosition()` helper function
   - Converts canvas coordinates to screen coordinates for overlay positioning
   - Accounts for font size and canvas scaling

3. **Removed Large Text Menu Panel** (lines 1364-1464 deleted)
   - Deleted "Text Content" textarea with label
   - Deleted "Font" label and dropdown
   - Deleted "Size" label and slider with pixel display
   - Deleted "Alignment" label and button row
   - Deleted "Text Color" label
   - Deleted character counter (42/280 characters)
   - Deleted large "Delete Text" button
   - Deleted entire grid layout structure

4. **Created Direct Text Editing Overlay**
   - Positioned `<textarea>` element absolutely over canvas text
   - Matches canvas text styling (font, size, color, alignment)
   - Auto-focuses when text selected
   - Multi-line support with proper line height
   - Max 280 characters (enforced silently, no counter displayed)
   - Transparent background with dashed border to show edit mode
   - Click away to deselect and commit changes
   - Type directly where text appears (true WYSIWYG)

5. **Created Compact Icon Toolbar**
   - Small toolbar positioned above selected text
   - Width: ~300px (vs full-width panel)
   - Height: 32px (single row vs multi-row grid)
   - Icon-based controls (no text labels)

   **Toolbar Contents:**
   - **Font Dropdown** (Aa▾): Compact select with 4 font options
   - **Size Dropdown** (Size▾): 5 preset sizes (Tiny/Small/Medium/Large/Huge)
   - **Align Left** (⬅): Icon button, highlighted when active
   - **Align Center** (⎯): Icon button, highlighted when active
   - **Align Right** (➡): Icon button, highlighted when active
   - **Color Swatches** (7 colored circles): Click to change color, ring shows active
   - **Delete** (×): Small red-bordered button

   **Styling:**
   - All controls height: 28px
   - Dropdowns: 12px text, minimal padding
   - Icon buttons: 28px × 28px
   - Color swatches: 20px × 20px
   - Gap between controls: 4px
   - Background: White with retro-border
   - Auto-positions to stay in viewport

**Result:**
- ✅ **~90% less vertical space** - 32px toolbar vs ~200px panel
- ✅ **Direct editing** - Type on canvas, not in separate field
- ✅ **Icon-based** - No labels, just intuitive icons/dropdowns
- ✅ **5 size presets** - Simpler than pixel slider
- ✅ **Hidden character limit** - No clutter, enforced silently
- ✅ **WYSIWYG** - Edit where text actually is
- ✅ **Compact** - Single row of controls vs multi-row grid
- ✅ **Consistent** - Matches inline image controls approach

**User Flow:**

**Before:**
1. Click Text tool
2. Click canvas → "New text" appears
3. Click text → large panel appears below toolbar
4. Type in separate "Text Content" textarea
5. Use labeled dropdowns/sliders/buttons for formatting
6. See character counter (42/280)
7. Click "Delete Text" button in panel

**After:**
1. Click Text tool
2. Click canvas → "New text" appears with **editing overlay + toolbar**
3. Text is immediately selected, ready to type
4. **Type directly on canvas** (overlay captures input)
5. Use compact icon toolbar above text for formatting
6. Click away → text committed
7. Click text again → edit overlay reappears

**Toolbar Interactions:**
- Font dropdown: Click → 4 font options → select
- Size dropdown: Click → 5 size presets → select
- Alignment: Click icon (⬅/⎯/➡) to change (active highlighted)
- Color: Click circle → change color (active has ring)
- Delete: Click × → text removed

**Technical Implementation:**
- IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to calculate positions inline
- `<textarea>` overlay positioned with absolute positioning
- Font/size/color/alignment applied via inline styles
- Auto-focus on selection
- Multi-line support with dynamic rows
- Coordinate conversion for proper overlay positioning
- Toolbar auto-adjusts position to stay within canvas bounds

**Visual Comparison:**

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Space used | ~200px panel | ~32px toolbar |
| Editing location | Separate textarea | Direct on canvas |
| Font control | Label + dropdown | Icon dropdown (Aa▾) |
| Size control | Label + slider + "48px" display | Preset dropdown (5 options) |
| Alignment | Label + 3 text buttons | 3 icon buttons (⬅⎯➡) |
| Color | Label + swatches | Just swatches (no label) |
| Character limit | "42/280 characters" | Hidden |
| Delete button | Large button in panel | Small × in toolbar |
| Layout | Multi-row grid | Single row |
