4. **Creation Rounds** (4 rounds, 60s each)
   - Round 1: Big Idea (text input)
   - Round 2: Headline (canvas + text)
   - Round 3: Visual (canvas)
   - Round 4: Pitch (text input)
   - "View Brief" button available during all rounds

   - "Play Again" option

8. **Real-time Features**
   - WebSocket-based game state sync
   - Player presence tracking
   - Phase transitions

   - Next.js 15 App Router
   - Shadcn UI components
   - Custom realtime server implementation

### Known Issues & Potential Improvements
1. **Canvas Rendering in Vote/Results** - Canvas visuals not currently displayed in voting/results pages (only text content shown)
2. **Vote Updates** - Voting page polls for status changes rather than using realtime websocket updates
3. **Multi-player Testing** - Need comprehensive testing with 3+ simultaneous players
4. **Reconnection Handling** - Edge cases around player disconnection/reconnection need hardening
5. **Performance** - Canvas operations and realtime updates could be optimized for larger player counts
6. **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support not yet implemented
7. **Error Handling** - Could improve user-facing error messages and recovery flows
8. **Analytics** - No tracking of game metrics or user behavior yet

### Next Session Priorities
1. âœ… ~~Apply database migrations~~ (COMPLETE)
2. âœ… ~~Complete terminology refactor~~ (COMPLETE)
3. âœ… ~~Regenerate database types~~ (COMPLETE)
4. âœ… ~~Implement voting system~~ (COMPLETE)
5. âœ… ~~Auto-generate briefs with AI~~ (COMPLETE)
6. âœ… ~~Add brief access during creation rounds~~ (COMPLETE)
7. **Canvas visual display improvements** - Show actual canvas renders in vote/results pages
8. **Realtime vote updates** - Replace polling with websocket events
9. **Multi-player testing** - Test with 3-5 simultaneous players, fix bugs
10. **End-to-end playtesting** - Complete game flow validation

- Applied database migrations (mantraâ†’pitch, pitchingâ†’presenting)
- Updated 27 files with consistent terminology
- All TypeScript compilation passing
- Committed to main branch (commit `697c39c`)

### Voting System - âœ… COMPLETE (October 24, 2025)

**Features:**
- Full vote validation (prevents duplicate votes and self-voting)
- Auto-transitions game to "results" when all votes are in
- Real-time vote counting and winner display
- Committed to main branch (commit `697c39c`)
